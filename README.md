# Furniture Store Project

## About the project

This project was made to display the products that a furniture store. It includes a landing page with fade effects as
you scroll down. The logo was also custom made.

The project was built using HTML, SCSS, jQuery and Gulp was used as a task runner.

## What I Learned

I learned more about using Bootstrap 4, using it to make the navbar and used the grid system to position the elements and
make it responsive. I also used jQuery to add in the fade on scroll effect.
